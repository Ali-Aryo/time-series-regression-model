# Chick Placement Time Series Forecasting

---
### Overview
This repository contains a time series analysis and forecast of weekly chick placements in Quebec and Ontario. The project uses historical data to build a predictive model for future placements.

### Model Used
The forecasting is performed using a **SARIMAX** (Seasonal AutoReg-ressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous Regressors) model. This is a powerful statistical method capable of modeling complex time-based patterns, including trends and annual seasonality (repeating patterns every 52 weeks).

### How to Use
The entire workflow, from data cleaning and visualization to model training and forecasting, is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook: `SARIMAX Model.ipynb`.
